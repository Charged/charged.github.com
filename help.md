### Texture "packs"

Charged Miners support both Modern and Classic terrain.png's. Normally
it will use the texture from the installed Minecraft version on the system.
You can overwrite this by placing a terrain.png in the texture folder,
this folder can be found via the "Open texture & screen-shot" button on the
options screen, accessed via the _Esc_ button when playing.

The file should be called terrain.png for a Modern Minecraft terrain.png
and terrain.classic.png for a Classic Minecraft texture. This is important
or things will look very odd.

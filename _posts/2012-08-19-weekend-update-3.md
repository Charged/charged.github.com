The big change this weekend is closer to classic behaviour on various things,
and that the menu background is custamizable. You can change it by placing
background.png and background.tiled.png in the texture folder, see
 [help](/help.html) for how it can be found.

 * Backgrounds are now custamizable.
 * Follow classic slot bar behavour.
 * Improved error messages a tiny bit.
 * Repeat block remove and place when holding mouse button.
 * _Fix_: Light and camera move when window not grabbed.
 * _Fix_: Ungrab happens on key up instead of key down.

Just run the launcher and it will update it automatically!

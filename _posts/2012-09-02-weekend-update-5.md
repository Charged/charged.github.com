title: Weekend update 5
---

Did lots and lots of code clean up and preperation for possible porting to D2.
Other then that fixed two bugs. And added a failsafe mode, active it by
setting the option mc.failsafe to true in settings.ini, see [help](/help.html)
for where to locate it.

 * Added logging when saving the screenshot.
 * Added failsafe mode to use safer graphics rendering.
 * _Fix_: Water no longer dissapears when in it.
 * _Fix_: Validate fov, invalid values caused rendering issues.

Just run the launcher and it will update it automatically!

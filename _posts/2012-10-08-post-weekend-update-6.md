Its been a while and a lot of changes gone into Charged Miners. The
default skin now works, you can replace it just like with the background,
see [help](/help.html) for how to do that.

Also like to thank Scoot, for his work on the Launcher, especially
now that mc.net seems to be having so much troubles.

 * Added support for "resuming" a connection to a server.
 * Remember the server hash instead of the server name for the list.
 * OtherPlayer movement much more smoother (Thanks Allie).
 * Download default player skin if not found.
 * Added a error message when the graphics card can't support Charged Miners.
 * Tweek player speeds to be more like classic.
 * _Fix_: Connect to correct mc.net address.
 * _Fix_: More chunk building fixes.
 * _Fix_: Spelling (Thanks Allie).
 * _Fix_: More logging of errors.
 * _Fix_: Halfslabs bottom not being drawn when halfslab beneath.
 * _Fix_: Fix certain skins causing segfaults.
 * _Fix_: Options lost on startup eroor.
 * _Fix_: Fix mouse grab moving the view.
 * _Fix_: Hide player name tags when hidden.

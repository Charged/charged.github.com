title: Launcher Update 1.23
tags: [main]
---

Charged-Miners Launcher has been updated several times this month. Launcher cannot update itself, so please [re-download it](http://cdn.charged-miners.com/launcher/ChargedMiners.exe) at your leisure. Changes since version 1.2:

 * Fixed log uploading.
 * Shortened the timeout for launcher update requests.
 * Fixed "Always" and "Never" game update preference getting mixed up.
 * Added warning when unchecking "Multiple accounts".
 * Unchecking "Multiple accounts" now actually erases account info right away, from disk and memory. Before, it waited until launcher closed.

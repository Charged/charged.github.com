title: Repo moved
---

I moved the main repository for Charged Miners to be under the Charged
orginazation instead of under my private github account. Due to this and the
fact that Mojang broke the www subdomain of minecraft.net you will need to
re-download the launcher again.

Sorry no auto-update, you will need to re-download the launcher.

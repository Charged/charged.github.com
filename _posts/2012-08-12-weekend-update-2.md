title: Weekend update 2
---

Trying to do one of these every weekend.

 * Added [help](/help.html) page on the homepage.
 * Added support for classic terrain.png ([help on using it](/help.html)).
 * Added a button on the options screen to open the texture folder.
 * Brought back debug info overlay (can be toggled with F3).
 * _Fix_: On non-uniformly sized maps top and bottom chunks would go missing.
 * _Fix_: With low FPS the idle function causes the cpu to spin.
 * _Fix_: Windows Intel GPU's showing white terrain.
 * _Fix_: Toughen up the code in some places.

Just run the launcher and it will update it automatically!

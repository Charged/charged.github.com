Scoot has done a bunch of work on the launcher, totally rewamping the UI,
adding a single button upload of logs (greatly helping debbing issues),
and much more... Many thanks Scoot.

 * New user interface! Now with tabs.
 * Added more options (starting tab, how to install game updates, whether to remember username/password/server).
 * Added some tools (resetting settings, clearing all data, opening data directory, submitting logs).
 * Allowed more kinds of mc:// URLs. Port number is now optional, and hostnames can be used in place of IPs.
 * Made "www." optional in minecraft.net URLs.
 * Made error messages more informative.
 * Added logging to %AppData%/charge/launcher.log.

You will need to download the launcher from the link at the top of the page.

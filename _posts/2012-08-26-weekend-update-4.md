Fixed some fallout from the move to the new startup code. Made the game a lot
more targeted at only classic by hiding the old main menu when launched from
the launcher. Made it a tiny bit more closer to vanilla classic, and also
added paste support to the chat.

 * You can now part back to the server list from the pause menu.
 * Canceling server connect and map change now loads the server list menu.
 * You can now resize the window by default (Windows only).
 * Water and Lava are not selectable (still placable).
 * You can now past into chat with ctrl+v (Windows only).
 * _Fix_: Crash on startup.
 * _Fix_: Custom Classic terrain not loading.
 * _Fix_: Logo not displaying at startup.

Just run the launcher and it will update it automatically!

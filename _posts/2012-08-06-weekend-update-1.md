So while this isn't the first weekend update that I have made its the first
that I document on the new page. Finishing the move to the new organization
on github and more work on this page is what I think I'll do the next
weekend. But now on to the changes:

 * Added fov option.
 * Chunks closer to the player is now generated first.
 * Started code reorg needed for texture pack support and classic textures.
 * _Fix_: On small maps the mesh builder would not build the last row of blocks.
 * _Fix_: Options menu dubplicated when changing fullscreen mode.
 * _Fix_: Stop moving when starting to chat or opening menu.
 * _Fix_: If AA is not supported make sure that you can't turn it on.

Just run the launcher and it should update automatically! Also Curiosity on Mars!

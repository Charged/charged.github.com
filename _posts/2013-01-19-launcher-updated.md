title: Launcher Update and updates not working.
---

Thanks to github breaking the download feature on their homepage that we
used to host the game updates, you will need to redownload the launcher
to get any more game updates.

Not everything is bad news tho, thanks to hard work by Scoot, the Launcher
also has a number of new features.

 * Change update URL, making updates working again.
 * Multiple accounts now supported.
 * Forgetting old accounts.
 * Passwords stored in a safer way.
 * Remember old sessions.

You will need to redownload the launcher from the link at the top of
the page to get them. Again thanks Scoot for working on the Launcher.

title: Launcher Update (you need it!)
tags: [main]

Thanks to GitHub.com breaking the download feature on their homepage that we
used to host the game updates, <b>you will need to redownload the launcher
to receive any future game updates.</b>

Not everything is bad news though: thanks to hard work by Scoot, the Launcher
also has a few new features and improvements:

 * Launcher can now remember multiple accounts (check the "Options" tab).
 * Your passwords are stored in a safer, encrypted way.
 * "Safe mode" checkbox was moved to the "Options" tab.
 * Some bugfixes and cosmetic improvements.

You will need to redownload the launcher from the link at the top of
the page to get them. Again thanks to Scoot for working on the Launcher.
